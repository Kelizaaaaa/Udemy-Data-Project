# Udemy Data Project
 A data project to explore data collected from Udemy's webpage

## Files
### Data
Udemy_Raw.csv --> Contains raw data extracted from Udemy
Udemy_Clean.csv --> Cleaned version of raw data

### Codes
Data Collection - Udemy Scrape.py --> Used for web scrapping of Udemy
Data Cleaning.ipynb --> Clean raw data obtained


## Data Collection Method
Data was scrapped using a combination of Selenium and BeautifulSoup to obtain information from Udemy's webpage (https://www.udemy.com/). To obtain a variety of data, course details from various subcategories were scrapped, and it was ensured that these courses were from a good mix of filters used. These filters ranked courses based on popularity, highest ratings, newest courses and free courses. 

## Data Cleaning
The data was relatively clean because there was control and customization during the web scrapping. In general, cleaning of data was quite minimal.
